# Autorice

This repository installs my dotfiles on a fresh install of any arch-based
distributions. I used this repo to automatically install my setup across 3
different devices, and try to keep it up to date with any programs or
configurations that I use.

## Install

On a fresh install of Artix linux, as root, run

```
curl -L https://almela.io/rice | sh
```
